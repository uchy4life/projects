## Introduction to the Business
### Case Study Overview
Zazzyza Pizza is a pizzeria renowned for its delicious,
promptly-served pizzas, embodying its catchy motto:
"Eat in a RUSH-Crave for MORE." Offering a delightful
array of classic and unique pizzas, RushMore Pizza aims to
provide a satisfying and speedy experience for every
customer. Whether it's a quick slice or a full box feast, the
commitment is to deliver iconic flavors that keep patrons
coming back for more.

### Problem Statement
Prior to this project, Zazzyz Pizza managed customer
orders primarily through manual methods. This approach
was becoming increasingly inefficient, especially during peak
hours, leading to potential errors in order taking, price
calculation, and discount application. Furthermore, the lack
of a digitized system meant there was no systematic way to
record or track sales data, making it difficult to analyze
business performance, identify popular items, or understand
customer purchasing patterns. This hindered operational
scalability and data-driven decision-making.

### Importance of the Project 
- Operational Efficiency
The system will automate core aspects of
the ordering process, including menu
display, item selection, price calculation
and the application of predefined
discounts.

- Foundational Sales Data Collection
By logging every order into a structured
JSON file, this will provides Zazzyza
Pizza with its first reliable method for sales
data accumulation for basic analysis.

- Customer Service and Consistency
The system offers customers a clear,
interactive menu which ensures that all
calculations are accurate and discounts are
applied consistently according to defined
rules.
